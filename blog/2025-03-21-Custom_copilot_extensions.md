# Custom copilot extensions

Was watching this video today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRgADkVL4Jo&t=5s&ab_channel=GitHub

In it, chris covers a bunch of topics from the changelog,
the interesting bit was that he created an custom extension for the `gh` cli

It is available here: https://github.com/chrisreddington/gh-game

It does sparks some ideas, of some tools that we can create in a customizable way, to be used in firm environments or similar
