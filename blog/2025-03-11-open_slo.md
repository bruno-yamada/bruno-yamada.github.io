# OpenSLO

Taking a look today at https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO (aka OSLO)

In number of stars, they have 1.4k, and are ranked 19th, in the
[specification](https://github.com/topics/specification) category, so not too
shabby

Their goal is to define a standard for defining SLOs to make it vendor-agnostic,
but they are not covering only SLOs, as part of the spec, they have:

- DataSource
- SLO
- SLI
- AlertPolicy
- AlertCondition
- AlertNotificationTarget
- Service

The usefulness will depend on how many tools adopt it (eg. dynatrace), I see
value in using it as a standard for `output`, so we could collect metrics from
existing SLOs in Dynatrace, and expose it as SLO, in compliance with the OpenSLO
spec, however, when it comes to output, there are some fields missing, for
example, it would be very useful to have fields such as the actual current value
of the SLO's error-budget, and whether it is compliant or not

They also considered creating `composite` SLOs, where it combines multiple SLOs
with weights assigned to each, and it comes to show it is a common practices

At the time of this writing, there is a `v2` being written:
https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO/blob/main/enhancements/v2alpha.md#slo

So right now, it is not very useful to my eyes, it could be interesting to see
how it evolves, and take lessons of it, from the perspective of it being a
community's understanding of what builds a SLO and the components around it, I'm
really more interested in the perspective of reporting SLOs, rather than
defining it in a declarative vendor-agnostic way
