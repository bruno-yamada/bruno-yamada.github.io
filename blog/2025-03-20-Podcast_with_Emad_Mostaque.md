# Podcast with Emad Mostaque

Finished listening to this video podcast today: [The 3 Year AI Reset: How To Get Ahead While Others Lose Their Jobs (Prepare Now) | Emad Mostaque](https://youtu.be/Se91Pn3xxSs?si=bFEMUW-ezfaerGv6)

It immediately made me a fan of both Tom and Emad, but specially of Emad, his background in Economics and his mind made him so captivating, he has great ideas and is great at explaining concepts,

Emad Mostaque is the former CEO & co-founder of [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), which can create video from images, text and others

I didn't want to lose this video, so creating this post

Another nice point is that I saw the video today, and it was filmed 1y ago, so I can see how some of their predictions have landed

The title is a bit click-baity, but it does relates to many of the topics they talk about

One of the most interesting concepts that stuck with me, was that GenAI in a sense is a compression of all of internet, compression is not the right word, but is a nice analogy,
eg. the internet is far bigger than 500gb, but ChatGPT is only 500gb, and in a way, it knows all of internet, and the same applies for image models

I don't remember if it was in this video or not, but there is also the fact that pretty much all the AI chips are built in Taiwan, and what happens if someone gets control of it? 
Then they have control of GenAI, and can get significantly ahead of countries that don't have it

Emad said multiple times, that it is moving so fast, that he could have a guess at how the landscape looks like in 1y, but in 2y? all best are off

During a part of the video they also mentioned [Wonder Dynamics](https://wonderdynamics.com/),
this is a nice video demoing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHTrHV0iKcA
