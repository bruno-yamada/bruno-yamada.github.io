# Stability.AI

Stability.AI is an big player in the world of artificial intelligence. They’re all about making AI accessible to everyone by focusing on `open-source models` and tools. Their mission resonates with a vision of democratizing AI, fostering innovation, and encouraging collaboration across industries, as stated multiple times by their former CEO, Emad Mostaque

The term "stability" is used due to their intent to democratizing AI by focusing on open-source models and tools that empower `individuals` and communities, in an inclusive way, ensuring that AI benefits everyone, not just a few.

## Why Stability.AI Stands Out
- **Open-Source Models**: They believe in transparency and community-driven progress, which is why their AI models are open-source. It’s a refreshing approach that empowers developers and researchers to contribute and innovate.
- **Accessibility for All**: Stability.AI designs tools that are easy to use, whether you’re a developer, researcher, or business professional. They’re breaking down barriers to entry in AI.
- **Pioneers in AI**: From generative AI to natural language processing and computer vision, they’re pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in artificial intelligence.

They focus on small "at the edge" models that can run on mobile devices, to democratize AI, instead of focusing on BIG models that can only be maintained by bit tech

## Real-World Impact
Stability.AI’s work is making a difference in so many areas:
- Helping artists and designers bring their ideas to life.
- Supporting groundbreaking scientific research.
- Streamlining business processes with automation.
- Enhancing education and training with innovative tools.
