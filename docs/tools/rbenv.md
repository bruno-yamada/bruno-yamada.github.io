# rbenv

Let's investigate and test usage of [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) for managing multiple versions of ruby on local laptop

## Why

Specially on Macs, ruby comes pre-installed and is required for the some parts of the sytem, so it is better to avoid using the "system's ruby" and, instead, use rubyenv to manage alternative ruby binaries

## Install

```bash 
brew install rbenv
```
